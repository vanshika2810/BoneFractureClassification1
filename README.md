## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Models:** VGG16, ResNet, CNN, Grad-CAM
- **Techniques Used:** Transfer Learning, Data Augmentation, Class Imbalance Handling

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Automated Detection:** Identifies bone fractures from medical images with high accuracy.
- **Classification:** Differentiates between various types of fractures.
- **Transfer Learning:** Utilizes pre-trained models like VGG16 and ResNet for better feature extraction.
- **Data Augmentation:** Enhances dataset diversity to improve model performance.
- **Real-time Clinical Support:** Assists radiologists in making quick and accurate diagnoses.

## 🚀 Implementation Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered a dataset containing X-ray, CT, and MRI images of fractured and non-fractured bones.
2. **Preprocessing:** Applied image normalization, resizing, and augmentation.
3. **Model Selection:** Used CNN architectures (VGG16, ResNet) for feature extraction and classification.
4. **Training & Validation:** Optimized hyperparameters and evaluated model performance.
